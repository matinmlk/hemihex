# HemiHex Documentation

This repository contains the documentation website for **HemiHex**, built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static site generator.

The goal of this site is to document our AI and computer-vision solutions for manufacturing and industrial automation, including:

- System architecture and components  
- Deployment guides for edge devices (e.g., Jetson boards)  
- Integration with MQTT, Redis, and other services  
- Best practices for data collection, labeling, and model deployment
